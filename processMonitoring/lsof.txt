lsof or 'list of Open Files' is used to define which files are open by which process.
Since linux/unix consider everything as a file (pipes, socket, directories, devices etc) we can use this command to identify which files are in current use.

#### LIST ALL OPEN FILES WITH lsof COMMAND #####

# lsof

Sections and it’s values are self-explanatory. However, we’ll review FD & TYPE columns more precisely.

FD – stands for File descriptor and may seen some of the values as:

    cwd current working directory
    rtd root directory
    txt program text (code and data)
    mem memory-mapped file

Also in FD column numbers like 1u is actual file descriptor and followed by u,r,w of it’s mode as:

    r for read access.
    w for write access.
    u for read and write access.

TYPE – of files and it’s identification.

    DIR – Directory
    REG – Regular file
    CHR – Character special file.
    FIFO – First In First Out
